# BMP180 Sensor Data to AWS

This project collects environmental data from a BMP180 sensor (temperature, pressure, and altitude) using a Raspberry Pi and sends it to a Flask server running on an AWS virtual machine (VM). The server stores and exposes the latest reading using GET and POST HTTP methods.
